<p>Instead of studying and analyzing coupled data, in practical study we usually need to cope with
    uncoupled data, that is, when labels and features are not paired together. Instead, you only have
    a set consisting of features and a set consisting of labels. The quesion is, can you still get some inference
    or information from such a dataset? Such a situation arises naturally in practical research, originally
    proposed in sociology and economic study, when the data you obtain is from two separate institute and you
    want to know whether there's a relation between these two factors. Sometimes, you can get data with the same
    individuals. In this case, you just need to induce a permutation in the indices of your data and pairing it.
    This is a relative simple and well-studied field, I think. And there's much paper studying it. But the case
    I confronted is worse than this. We are not even assured that the data are from the same individuals.
    In other words, we just obtain data from the two institute independently or we are just sampling from two
    distributions and we want to determine the relation between these two distributions. The motivation to study
    such a problem is from biology, where after each measurement the cells are dead and you cannot get coupled
    data. One possible solution might be using optimal transport to modeling the difference between two
    distributions. As for the high-dimensional version, we just need to try to merging ways to tackling sparse and
    optimal transport to make a further discussion. Maybe compressed sensing can be a good choice for the former one.</p>
