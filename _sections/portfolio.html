<p>Chemical reaction network (CRN) is now a rather active field studying the kinetics and the thermodynamics of a system consisting of
multiple species and reactions. Using statistical physical and chemical physical tools, people are now trying to understand these 
two aspects theoretically. Moreover, the bridge between these two angles is always an interesting topic to investigate. However, the
rigorous establishment of the proposed laws, the deeper insights into the potential mechanism as well as how these basic laws build up
and formalize the phenomenon we see in the lab is still lacking. Recent developments mainly focus on the relation between the macroscopic
model and the microscopic model since the advent of the quantum mechanics. But as the microscopic model will introduce too much variables.
A moderate version is always preferred, then mesoscopic model becomes the link between these two models. This is where 
probability and multiscale theory emerge and can be applied to make the theory more rigorous and complete. More detalis is listed in
